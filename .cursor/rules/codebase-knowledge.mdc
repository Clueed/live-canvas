# Codebase Knowledge

- This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager.
- The **zod** library is used for schema validation and type-safe data parsing.
- **Biome** is used for linting and formatting the codebase.
- Utility functions `tryCatchSync` and `tryCatchAsync` in `src/utils/try-catch.ts` are available for wrapping function calls in try-catch blocks.
